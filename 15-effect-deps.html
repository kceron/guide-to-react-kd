<!-- React.useEffect accepts a second argument as an optimization to combat this problem. that second arg is a dependency array, where you pass all the dependencies for your side effect. this is where you pass anything that you want to make sure you synchronize the state of the world with the state of our application(8). in our case, the only thing that we're trying to synchronize here is the state of localStorage. which is the state of the world, with the state of our application. which is the name. for our dependency array we provide the [name]. -->

<!-- its important to keep our dependencu array accurate according to the dependencies that our callback function relies on. else our users can lose work -->

<!-- eslint-plugin-react-hooks can be used to not only ensure that the dependency array is kept up-to-date, but keep it up-to-date automatically for you, using ESLints fix feature. The rule that will help you with this is the exhaustive-deps rule  -->
