<!-- error boundary have to be class components, and to create a class component with react,
class ErrorBoundary exteds React.Component {
  render(){

  }
} -->

<!-- we know that rendering custom components requires that the 1st character we use is capitalized,
but the compiler also has a rule that if there are dots included in the component name, 
then those will also be treated as custom components,
which is why this works(17) -->

<!-- with the React Error Boundary UMD Export,
it exposes a global variable called ReactErrorBoundary and it has a property on there called ErrorBoundary(8).
this will work the same as our ErrorBoundary class -->

<!-- this errorBoundary can be rendered anywhere in the tree.
but the location of the errorBoundary has a special significance. 
the errorB can handle any errors that are thrown by its descendants,
the errorB is going to render something in place of all of its descendants where there is an error,
so where we place it is important,
this is going to give us some fine-grained control over what part of the tree is going to be replaced by whats rendered by our error boundary
-->

<!-- errorB can only handle errors that are happening within the react call stack like the render method or a react useEffect callback, 
NOT errors that are happening in event handlers or if theres an error in an async callback like a promise handler  -->

<!-- with the error boundary from the react-error-boundary library, you can provide a FallbackComponent.
that component will be rendered in the event of an error,
allowing you to recover from the error or simply display an error message for the user to read -->
