<!-- when you create these React elems(12/15), you give that to ReactDom.render or you trigger a re-render of a component, and react is going to compare the elems that you returned this time with the elems that you returned last time. And then it will update the DOM surgically, to only update the things that are different between the last time and this time you returned jsx -->
