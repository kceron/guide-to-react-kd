<!-- if we ever need to make the input value something different from what the user is actually typing, we can do so by passing the value prop  -->

<!-- here instead of displaying an error to the user when they dont use all lower case we just make that change for them. -->

<!-- to control the input's value - as soon as we passed the 'value' prop on to an input,
we're communicating to React that react no longer needs to manage the state of this input.
now we are going to control that state and it should not change that value to anything other what we enter in here, which includes whatever the user's typing. 
this is going to lowercase the string automatically as the user types  -->
